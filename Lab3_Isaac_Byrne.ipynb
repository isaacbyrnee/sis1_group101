The reference signal lasts about 3.5 seconds and shows clear decay over time, with higher harmonics fading before the end. It has a broader spectral bandwidth (around 737 Hz) and a mean spectral centroid of about 828 Hz, giving it a richer and more natural sound. In contrast, the synthesized signal maintains constant harmonic power throughout the same 3.5-second duration, with a narrower bandwidth (around 430 Hz) and a mean centroid of about 750 Hz. Its energy is mainly concentrated in the first few harmonics (up to about 8 × f₀ ≈ 4000 Hz). Overall, the reference sounds fuller and more complex, while the synthesized version is clearer but simpler and more tonal."
